# AAML

- [ ] Trying to solve the anti aliasing problem with machine learning models. In this project, 3x3 filter used for prediction the middle pixels RGBA values.

- [x] For this project .png, .jpg and .jpeg image files can be used for the dataset.

- [x] At this point, it is important to enlarge the data set. After that, training will be done using the machine learning model and dataset and tests will be done on many pictures.
